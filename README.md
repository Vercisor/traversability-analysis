# From Earthly Terrains to Martian Landscapes: Deep Learning Approaches for Traversability Analysis

This repo contains some of the files used in the development of my Bachelor's thesis at SUPSI.

## Running the UI
In order to run the UI it is necessary to install the required packages and the Robomaster python package, which can be found here: https://github.com/dji-sdk/RoboMaster-SDK

Once you are done with the installation, you need to connect to the robomaster via "ap" connection and run the gui_main.py file
